Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

//
// IMPORTING STYLES
//

// import normalize
@import "_normalize.less";

// import mixins
@import "_mixins.less";

/*
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.

// styles in base.less
@import "_base.less";

/*
ADDING AND REMOVING RESPONSIVE GRID
If the theme was just installed, it is NOT responsive. To convert the
theme to the responsive version you must adjust and remove comments 
in a few less files included below:

	- style.less (this file) 
		- Comment or remove grid.less and _768up.less imports around lines 49 - 50
		- Remove commenting around grid.less line 71
	- _768up.less
		- Remove min-width from body around line 22
		- Switch wrap width to max-width around line 51
*/

/*
LARGER MOBILE DEVICES
This is for devices like the Galaxy Note or something that's
larger than an iPhone but smaller than a tablet. Let's call them
tweeners.

	// styles in 481up.less
	@import "_481up.less";

/*
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*/

RETINA (2x RESOLUTION DEVICES)
This applies to the retina iPhone (4s) and iPad (2,3) along with
other displays with a 2x resolution. You can also create a media
query for retina AND a certain size if you want. Go Nuts.

iPHONE 5 MEDIA QUERY
Want to get fancy for no good reason? Knock yourself out.

PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
